AlloySpec generateInputSpec(Classfiles jar, Method m,
                            Formula pre) {
  result is alloy specification consisting of:
    sig declarations for (pre)state
    foreach class C in jar (which does not have a library spec)
      sig declaration for C
    foreach field f declared in class C
      if f is of reference type T
        field declaration, f: T ?-> State, in sig C
      if f is of primitive type T
        field declaration, f: T !-> State, in sig C
    function repOk that has signature corresponding to that of m
    and has as body pre (i.e., mâ€™s precondition), where
      each field f is replaced by f::Pre
}
